                <h1>Rubik's Invention</h1>

                    <p>    In the mid-1970s, Ern≈ë Rubik worked at the Department of Interior Design at the Academy of Applied Arts and Crafts in Budapest.</p>
                        <p>  Although it is widely reported that the Cube was built as a teaching tool to help his students understand 3D objects, his actual purpose was solving the structural problem.</p>
                    
                            <p> The puzzle made its international debut at the toy fairs of London, Paris, Nuremberg, and New York in January and February 1980.</p>
                                <p>  - There are 8! (40,320) ways to arrange the corner cubes.</p>
                                    <p> - You need to be stronger at Algorithims!</p>
                                        <p> - Rubik's Cube for each permutation, one could cover the Earth's surface 275 times, or stack them in a tower 261 light-years high.</p>
